You'll be booking with an AirBnB Superhost, this is a strong indicator that the best will be done for your stay here.

The part I enjoy the most in hosting is giving my guests a real welcome that will make you feel a little more like you actually know the city. 
In practice that means that on your arrival you'll get a cool map and plenty of recommendations, as well as that I'll attempt to answer all of your questions about the city :).

Besides this you can count on: 
* prompt communication 
* easy arrival with very well done instructions 
* super clean apartments 
* proper beddings to enjoy your holidays 
* a direct contact for me and help any time you need it

If I am not in the city when you arrive, you'll either be in contact with my boyfriend or one of our great friends. We all share the same values about hosting: to make your time in Prague as great as possible and unforgettable.

Hosting is a hobby for me but I take it very seriously. 
My goal is to provide much more than accommodation to my guests, as I know from my own traveling experiences how great a difference it means to have personal contact with your host. My reviews tell a good story of how I succeed. :)

Besides AirBnB
My philosophy is to only do things that I enjoy doing, so that I can devote more time and energy to what is really important to me.
In my professional life I work in the non-profit sector as a project coordinator. I am interested in education, human rights activism, arts, languages, and people in general.

mein Name ist Pavel Vrba und bin Inhaber der Firma Pragtour. 
Diese habe ich 1992 in Deutschland gegründet mit der Idee, deutschen Studenten und Professoren Unterkünfte in Prag für ein paaar Tage 
Urlaub oder 1-2 Semester an der Karls-Universität anzubieten. 
Ich wohnte in Duisburg, damals hieß die heutige Universität Duisburg-Essen noch Gesamthochschule Duisburg. Meine ersten Kunden waren also Studenten aus Duisburg, Essen, Bochum, Dortmund und Düsseldorf, die Plakate an den schwarzen Bretten ihrer Unis sahen und bei mir dann reservierten. Seit 2007 wohne ich wieder in der Tschechischen Republik von wo aus ich die Firma in dem Sinne weiter betreibe wie schon in den 90-ern. 
---
Wie ich gerade lese, soll ich auch etwas über mich erzählen, 
damit ihr etwas über mich erfährt und somit Vetrauen aufgebaut 
werden kann. 
Nun, ich denke, Vertrauen gewinnt man nicht durch das Plaudern, 
sondern durch reale Erlebnisse, d.h. erst wenn man mich real kennengelernt bzw. einige Zeit in meinen Appartements verbracht

mein Name ist Pavel Vrba und bin Inhaber der Firma Pragtour. 
Diese habe ich 1992 in Deutschland gegründet mit der Idee, deutschen Studenten und Professoren Unterkünfte in Prag für ein paaar Tage 
Urlaub oder 1-2 Semester an der Karls-Universität anzubieten. 
Ich wohnte in Duisburg, damals hieß die heutige Universität Duisburg-Essen noch Gesamthochschule Duisburg. Meine ersten Kunden waren also Studenten aus Duisburg, Essen, Bochum, Dortmund und Düsseldorf, die Plakate an den schwarzen Bretten ihrer Unis sahen und bei mir dann reservierten. Seit 2007 wohne ich wieder in der Tschechischen Republik von wo aus ich die Firma in dem Sinne weiter betreibe wie schon in den 90-ern. 
---
Wie ich gerade lese, soll ich auch etwas über mich erzählen, 
damit ihr etwas über mich erfährt und somit Vetrauen aufgebaut 
werden kann. 
Nun, ich denke, Vertrauen gewinnt man nicht durch das Plaudern, 
sondern durch reale Erlebnisse, d.h. erst wenn man mich real kennengelernt bzw. einige Zeit in meinen Appartements verbracht 
hat. Ich finde, erst dann kann man vom Vertrauen sprechen.

Welcome to my beautiful apartment in Prague, but before I continue, a few lines about myself.

I am very passionate about Prague (in Czech we say Praha) and I love interior design. I could never be an architect, as my walls would never hold together, but once the dirty work is done, it is my turn to change the bare walls into an awe inspiring space. Being very creative, I still like to explore the four corners of the world to get a little bit inspired and then, with a head full of ideas, I return to Praha to materialize it.

Meanwhile, I enjoy meeting travelers all around the world and host them at my apt. which provides a perfect starting point to explore the city. My check-ins are very informative, sometimes so much that it made me write my own guide which you will find in the apartment.

You'll be booking with an AirBnB Superhost, this is a strong indicator that the best will be done for your stay here.

The part I enjoy the most in hosting is giving my guests a real welcome that will make you feel a little more like you actually know the city. 
In practice that means that on your arrival you'll get a cool map and plenty of recommendations, as well as that I'll attempt to answer all of your questions about the city :).

Besides this you can count on: 
* prompt communication 
* easy arrival with very well done instructions 
* super clean apartments 
* proper beddings to enjoy your holidays 
* a direct contact for me and help any time you need it

If I am not in the city when you arrive, you'll either be in contact with my boyfriend or one of our great friends. We all share the same values about hosting: to make your time in Prague as great as possible and unforgettable.

Hosting is a hobby for me but I take it very seriously. 
My goal is to provide much more than accommodation to my guests, as I know from my own traveling experiences how great a difference it means to have personal contact with your host. My reviews tell a good story of how I succeed. :)

Besides AirBnB

We are located in Žižkov, which is just three tram stops from Václavské Námestí (the heart of Prague’s center).

I am very passionate about Prague (in Czech we say Praha) and I love interior design. I could never be an architect, as my walls would never hold together, but once the dirty work is done, it is my turn to change the bare walls into an awe inspiring space. Being very creative, I still like to explore the four corners of the world to get a little bit inspired and then, with a head full of ideas, I return to Praha to materialize it.

Meanwhile, I enjoy meeting travelers all around the world and host them at my apt. which provides a perfect starting point to explore the city. My check-ins are very informative, sometimes so much that it made me write my own guide which you will find in the apartment.

I am very passionate about Prague (in Czech we say Praha) and I love interior design. I could never be an architect, as my walls would never hold together, but once the dirty work is done, it is my turn to change the bare walls into an awe inspiring space. Being very creative, I still like to explore the four corners of the world to get a little bit inspired and then, with a head full of ideas, I return to Praha to materialize it.

Meanwhile, I enjoy meeting travelers all around the world and host them at my apt. which provides a perfect starting point to explore the city. My check-ins are very informative, sometimes so much that it made me write my own guide which you will find in the apartment.

Being very creative, I still like to explore the four corners of the world to get a little bit inspired and then, with a head full of ideas, I return to Praha to materialize it.

Meanwhile, I enjoy meeting travelers all around the world and host them at my apt. which provides a perfect starting point to explore the city. My check-ins are very informative, sometimes so much that it made me write my own guide which you will find in the apartment.

He translates from czech to french for the nuclear industry, but also picaresque literature. He studied actuarial science, but also in the Czech National Film School and was the artistic director of a Film Festival in Rouen, which he co-founded in total confusion and which has been doing very well in south America since he stopped running it. He has been a performer in czech theaters and continues to practice non-acting, being perfectly in his element at the bottom of the sea among fishes. He does painting with people called mentally handicapped and loves the freedom of those shared moments. Sometimes he works seriously in an association that helps young Madagascans, by supporting their study or professional projects. He goes from time to time to recharge his batteries in Corsica, in the sole company of wild boars and morays. He likes kirsch soufflé and good restaurants.


Boris, born in 1980,  is Slovak, and is a trained translator/interpreter. He speaks multiple languages - perfectly Czech, Slovak, and French ;  well English, Hebrew, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic ; and a little bit Italian, Hungarian, German and Russian. He studied also medicine, and at the Ecole hôtelière de Lausanne. His passions: Jewish culture, bakery and pastry, the psychology of plants and their musical preference (Madonna for the roses and klezmer music for the tomatoes). He likes activities that require precision - linocut, calligraphy and soap making. He likes also everything that falls apart and especially buildings in ruins, but don't worry : Jakub is careful that the apartments we offer do not correspond to those romantic tastes of Rome antic. Boris gets along well with children, and would be an excellent father, however only Benjamin, our robot vacuum cleaner, will take care of us in our old age.

When we are on vacation, it is usually our friend Tomaš who replaces us. Tomaš was born in 1985, and he leads a totally ecological and respectful life for our planet. He produces very little CO2, even when he breathes. He lives in his garden, without gas or electricity, in the light and warmth of the sun. If you want a bouquet of flowers, ask Tomaš, he will create you a bouquet of flowers of his own fields which reflects his cheerful, free and independent personality.

Our team would not be complete without Ksenia and Riccardo who clean all the apartments and rooms with dedication and love. Their totem animals are the panda and the snoopy.  Ksenia speaks Czech, English, Ukrainian and Russian while Riccardo speaks English and Spanish. Ksenia is creative on her bike with the big lizard she saved from the cold, Riccardo is doing a master in economics and is a rational and kind person you can totally trust.

I am very passionate about Prague (in Czech we say Praha) and I love interior design. I could never be an architect, as my walls would never hold together, but once the dirty work is done, it is my turn to change the bare walls into an awe inspiring space. Being very creative, I still like to explore the four corners of the world to get a little bit inspired and then, with a head full of ideas, I return to Praha to materialize it.

Meanwhile, I enjoy meeting travelers all around the world and host them at my apt. which provides a perfect starting point to explore the city. My check-ins are very informative, sometimes so much that it made me write my own guide which you will find in the apartment.

I am 23 years old guy, who was bartender, waiter and in present day I work in travel agency. I finished University of Business in Prague and I'm going to move to Scotland with my GF, so I rent my flat in 3floors family house, which is situated in the edge of Prague. I live with my mom, dad and brother, who live in the 2nd floor and with my ""mad"" grandpa, who lives in the middle. Every floor is separated. We have one cuddly black dog called Shary. I love mainly hard music - guitar but also electronic. Especially trash metal and tekno, hardcore music. I am freak, ex-smoker of marijuana, ex-user of hell knows what, but I am interested in books, science, art (including pornography), history, astronomy and other (for me) interesting things. I really love works, no matter which one, but I love it. I don't have any motto, but I have transparent opinion: Today's world has two enormous problems, which are blind ignorance and exaggerated solidarity.

My parents are still young, they're very friendly and both of them speak english (don't care grammar). Mother speaks also little Italian and father Russian and Norwegian. 
My mom Romana works as social worker in children's home and also as accountant in Beer Restaurant in the centre of Prague. She will be your main host. She is very likeable and really tolerant, also she cooks very well. She loves literature, ""boring"" holidays when you just lie on the beach, sports and also good white wine. She is nice.

My dad Petr is aircraft mechanic, but he is freelancer. He used to be a head mechanic in military airport Prague-Kbely, but there were some problems, so he decided to get out. He travels a lot, because he has very good licenses, authorizations for reviews and others important documents. He was in Germany, Belgium, Norway, USA, French Guyana, South Africa etc. He has contract with some businessman in Georgia (next to Russia) now, so he flights there twice a month for few days. He likes relaxing in our summer house in Vysocina, where we have a small farm. He also likes ice hockey, rock music and beer. 

John, he is my younger brother, who thinks, that he will be a football star. He is 15 years old and next year he's going to finish elementary school. But he does not know yet, what to do in future. He knows, that professional footballer is just fantasy. But he could be a professional lazybones, cause he is not able to take out the garbage. 

And my grandfather? You will see... He is like mad science fiction character, who is greedy and save every fakin coin, because everything is so expensive. I love him, because I know, that he used to be fine, maybe somewhere in his soul... But no mercy, it's really funny to do him on purpose. The big advantage - you won't see him and if yes - he cannot speak english (Achtung! Er sprichts Deutsch!).

 I think, these are basic facts about me and my family, which you will meet sometimes.

Four action-packed years later it was time to wander further afield: this time spending months in Thailand and then in Indonesia.

Even the happy wanderer settles down occasionally, and so it was that I came to spend just under 10 years living in London. Fortunately, London is a global hub and that made it easy for me to make frequent trips to other amazing cities like Los Angeles, racking up the frequent flyer miles.

Sometimes the best thing to do with all that experience is bring it home and share it with the people and places you know best. That’s why I relocated back to a bustling and vibrant Prague in 2013.

Having worked in world-famous casinos since 1997, I knows exactly what the exceptional customer experience should look and feel like.

Being very creative, I still like to explore the four corners of the world to get a little bit inspired and then, with a head full of ideas, I return to Praha to materialize it.

Meanwhile, I enjoy meeting travelers all around the world and host them at my apt. which provides a perfect starting point to explore the city. My check-ins are very informative, sometimes so much that it made me write my own guide which you will find in the apartment.

Four action-packed years later it was time to wander further afield: this time spending months in Thailand and then in Indonesia.

Even the happy wanderer settles down occasionally, and so it was that I came to spend just under 10 years living in London. Fortunately, London is a global hub and that made it easy for me to make frequent trips to other amazing cities like Los Angeles, racking up the frequent flyer miles.

Sometimes the best thing to do with all that experience is bring it home and share it with the people and places you know best. That’s why I relocated back to a bustling and vibrant Prague in 2013.

Having worked in world-famous casinos since 1997, I knows exactly what the exceptional customer experience should look and feel like.

glad to see that you are interested in our beautiful city, Prague!

My name is Klara, I’m 25 years old and I live in Prague - magical Central European city. I love nature and great food (preferably Asian and Italian cuisine). I have recently fallen for jogging – it boosts me with energy and perfectly prepares for a new day. I also love adrenaline experiences in general - camping, all kinds of sports (skiing, squash or badminton) or even rafting.

I work with a group of young enthusiastic people (mostly students) and together we are renting a number of apartments in the centre of Prague here on Airbnb.

I graduated from the Prague conservatory, so technically I am an actress :) but through my passion for travelling, I diverted to the hospitality fields and Airbnb which inspired me to study Hospitality Management and later Interior design as well.  So currently I work in a mixture of fields which fits me well as it is never boring and always stimulating :) Besides that, I'm also a proud mum of now already 8-year-old son. So yes, I never get bored :)))

Together with my family and friends, I started a hospitality service concentrated on a personal approach and high-end quality experience delivery to YOU - our dear guests from all around the Globe! From the very beginning, we wanted to be honest, and dedicated to our values which lay in providing a unique, throughout the authentic experience. It is our passion to always better ourselves in providing you with as amazing a time as possible while vacationing in Prague, our magical city. We all have different backgrounds in art, culture, sport and hospitality fields and we believe the mixture adds to your experience while staying in one of our Airbnb homes. 

When I say “We” it means Me, Klara, Adam, Vaclav, Mischa, Alina & Alisa, Nora, Viktoria & Světlanka & My parents Otakar and Romana. 

You already know me, now let me introduce you to the rest. 

I met Klara at my first job in the hospitality field about 15 years ago already. (Time flies!) We were both managers of nightlife tours around Prague (The Clock tower bar crawl tours). She spent a lot of time travelling after that & she lived and worked in Thailand, Croatia, England and USA. She has also been a part of a boat cruise for a year. When she finally returned to Prague, I got in touch with her and she is now my right hand. 

Adam, besides being the best ""IT"" specialist in our team, is also a professional 1st league footballer, so he currently makes two teams better ours and FC Chrudim. &If you want to know what is happening in the world of sports its definitely best to ask him :)

Vaclav graduated from a prestige college, where he concentrated on humanity fields and politics. He joined us just before the pandemic started and became an important member of the team. He is very creative and always strives to improve Airstay with new ideas. 

Viktoria grew up in Czechia while of ukrainian roots. She loves to travel , lived and worked in hostels in Germany for a while and when she moved back to Prague she looked to stay in the ""travelling atmosphere""  and so she does in Airstay. She speaks German, English and Ukrainian. 

Mischa and Electra are siblings, both are born Czech but they grew up in South Africa, they recently moved back from Johannesburg to Prague and as their passion lies in hospitality, they joined us and are now naturally co-hosting with us.  They speak Dutch, English and Czech. 

Iva and Nora joined in recently as they were both looking to stay active while on their maternity leave & because they have both always worked in hospitality industry, Airstay has been an ideal match for them. Iva speaks Spanish and English and Czech. Nora speaks Russian and English. 

Alina and Alisa, sisters,  are the newest additions to our team. 
They moved here recently from Ukraine, Mariupol. Aline is a language prodigy as she speaks Czech, English, Korean, Russian and Ukrainian.  Alise is an HR professional and her passion lies in working with people.  They are both also Svetlankas family friends. 

Světlanka is originally also from Ukraine. I met her for the first time right after my son was born and I was seeking housekeeping help. We became friends almost in an Instant and she is now also a heart of housekeeping.

My parents, Otakar and Romana. My father has been a property manager and technical maintenance manager for his entire life. His passion is history, especially the Czech monarchy. My mother always worked in administrative departments which she makes up for through her interests in yoga and alternative fields such as astrology and numerology. My father helps to maintain your Airbnb homes in great technical condition and my mum helps with the mandatory foreign police administrative. 

So now you know as all! Upon your check-in you can meet any of us, if you have a special request on who you would like to meet, you can let us know – and we will try to make it happen!

We promise to do the maximum, so you get the true authentic feeling in our homes and through our recommendations and through experiences that we organize. We love our hometown and We would be happy to help you discover all the secrets of Prague!

I have recently fallen for jogging – it boosts me with energy and perfectly prepares for a new day. I also love adrenaline experiences in general - camping, all kinds of sports (skiing, squash or badminton) or even rafting.

I work with a group of young enthusiastic people (mostly students) and together we are renting a number of apartments in the centre of Prague here on Airbnb. I have a lot of experience with tourism, since I work in hospitality industry for a fifth year now. That’s why I can recommend a lot of great and interesting cafés, restaurants and secret places only the locals know. It's my passion (and also the passion of my team) to get to know new people, new cultures and experience something interesting every day. For that reason I love Airbnb that much - it made possible that my passion is now my everyday reality. 
 
With a help of my team, I am really doing my best to make every stay of our guests an unforgettable experience. Feel free to ask me anything, I am available 24/7.

glad to see that you are interested in our beautiful city, Prague!

My name is Klara, I’m 25 years old and I live in Prague - magical Central European city. I love nature and great food (preferably Asian and Italian cuisine). I have recently fallen for jogging – it boosts me with energy and perfectly prepares for a new day. I also love adrenaline experiences in general - camping, all kinds of sports (skiing, squash or badminton) or even rafting.

I work with a group of young enthusiastic people (mostly students) and together we are renting a number of apartments in the centre of Prague here on Airbnb. I have a lot of experience with tourism, since I work in hospitality industry for a fifth year now. That’s why I can recommend a lot of great and interesting cafés, restaurants and secret places only the locals know. It's my passion (and also the passion of my team) to get to know new people, new cultures and experience something interesting every day. For that reason I love Airbnb that much - it made possible that my passion is now my everyday reality.

Welcome to my beautiful apartment in Prague, but before I continue, a few lines about myself.

I am very passionate about Prague (in Czech we say Praha) and I love interior design. I could never be an architect, as my walls would never hold together, but once the dirty work is done, it is my turn to change the bare walls into an awe inspiring space. Being very creative, I still like to explore the four corners of the world to get a little bit inspired and then, with a head full of ideas, I return to Praha to materialize it.

Meanwhile, I enjoy meeting travelers all around the world and host them at my apt. which provides a perfect starting point to explore the city. My check-ins are very informative, sometimes so much that it made me write my own guide which you will find in the apartment.

For three fun-filled years, I explored and experienced everything that Prague had to offer, before moving on to Tel Aviv – arguably one of the world’s coolest places. Four action-packed years later it was time to wander further afield: this time spending months in Thailand and then in Indonesia.

Even the happy wanderer settles down occasionally, and so it was that I came to spend just under 10 years living in London. Fortunately, London is a global hub and that made it easy for me to make frequent trips to other amazing cities like Los Angeles, racking up the frequent flyer miles.

Sometimes the best thing to do with all that experience is bring it home and share it with the people and places you know best. That’s why I relocated back to a bustling and vibrant Prague in 2013.

Having worked in world-famous casinos since 1997, I knows exactly what the exceptional customer experience should look and feel like.

In my free time, I explore both famous and secret places here in Prague - there are so many spots worth visiting!

I work in the import department of a big e-commerce business. I love travelling and learning about new technologies, and hate Olomoucké tvarůžky cheese:) 

What I enjoy the most is meeting new people and cultures. I believe we can all learn a lot from different stories from each person we meet. That was the reason why I started hosting on Airbnb in the first place! 

If you book my place, I will take care of you like of my friend andshare with you how local's life looks here in Prague. Airbnb is about belonging and I want to make my guests feel that they can belong here too.

Our hosting style
We pay a great deal of attention to every guest, because we want everyone to feel at home, to have all the possible information about the area that they visit, and to be pleased with our service.

Firstly, we ask what time the guest arrives, and how they will get here. We always advise the easiest way to our apartment.

The apartment is fully equipped. We have encountered a situation, when we came a foreign apartment, and there was not even bedding. That will not happen with us, as we will take care of you! :) Guests can contact us via email or telephone any time during their stay.
